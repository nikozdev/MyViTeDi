- anyone can manually copy files to appropriate locations
> - on unix systems:

> > - "shared" is "~/.local/share/nvim"
> - on windows:
> > - "config" is "~/appdata/local/nvim"
> > - "shared" is "~/appdata/local/nvim-data"
- or you can use the make script instead
> - "make setup" to install
> - "make reset" will not work because it is really risky
